Wifi don't work natively, so i use a TP LINK dongle (TL-WN725N) 
Driver that i use: https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter

Bluetooth working but i am having a little trouble to connect on macOS Sonoma.

I also use a SSD with TRIM enabled.
My acer is stock except for the SSD.

Headphone Jack do a cracking sound when connected, so i use a script on my Application folder that run on startup.
(Jack fix)

My EFI folder contains opencore with picker enabled and verbose mode on.
